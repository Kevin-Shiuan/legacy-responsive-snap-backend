# legacy-responsiveSnap-backend

This is the backend for the responsiveSnap project. It use the [capture-website](https://github.com/sindresorhus/capture-website/tree/main) made by sindresorhus to take the screenshots. It use Puppeteer under the hood.

However, I switch to use Playwright instead of Puppeteer, due to some deployment issues.

You can find new version of this project [here](https://github.com/Kevin-Shiuan/responsiveSnap-backend)
